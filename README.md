# Home-page-for-a-wedding-planar-website
1. This project is about a simple home page of a wedding planner website that has vendor types & their names which are already associated with the company on the front page itself. 
2. It is not like only the vendors given on front page are the only ones who associated with the company, but these are some famous shops associated with the company.

3.It is a frontend website only no backend is associated with it, also no button will work but if you press the register button, one form will open which will ask for Your details, also when you click on submit button it will redirect you to home page.

5.To smoothly run this web page you have to download all the files in the repository in one folder & run it in vs code.

6.The project uses simple html tags & css styling functions for styling & simple java script code for redirecting.

7.I am attaching here some photos for how the website is exactly looking:
